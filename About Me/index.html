    <h2>Ryan</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Ryan Meode and I came from the Philippines! I love discovering 
       new knowledge and in learning new skills (more on technical skills).</p>
    <p>I'm currently working as an assistant to a freelance web developer here in my place,
       that's why I learn web development and build my desire to take on this career.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 
       3 years now. And know I'm currently preparing myself and my family (they are not member) to go on a mission! </p>
